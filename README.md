# Javascript Project Proposal

## Project Description
  A frogger-like game with a twist.  The player controls a flea trying to travel from the front door to the kitchen.  The only thing is that the flea has to move quick, or the food would disappear, and the only way to travel quickly is via the backs of the furry inhabitants of the building.  The larger the animals, the easier the target, but the slower they travel, and vice-versa.  Multiple levels, with each level subsequently harder then the last.
  

### Game Design
  1. User control and interaction between ships and player
  2. Pre-programmed/randomized routes for animals
  3. Collision implementation.
  4. Well thought out level designs.  (Hopefully, up to three completed by Friday)
  6. Simple controls (left-arrow and right-arrow keys, and spacebar)
  7. Intuitive play


### MVPs
  1. A production ready README.md file

  2. A hosting site

  3. Moving Object Class
    * Movement
    * Collision
    * Bug-free
    * Canvas collision artifacts

  4. Player < Moving Object Class
    * Player controls
    * Intuitive / Smooth
    * Bug-free

  5. Animals < Moving Object Class
    * Randomly generated moves
    * Dog < Animals : its own velocity / size / movement constraint
    * Cat < Animals : its own velocity / size / movement constraint
    * Rat < Animals : its own velocity / size / movement constraint
  
  7. Modal
    * Basic controls

  8. User Interface
    * Smooth / visually appealing


  Bonus:
  1. Points System
    * Based on time completion
    * Based on animals ridden?


### Wireframes
  Temporary:

  2. Libraries:
      * Anime
      * Canvas
