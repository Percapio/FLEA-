# FSP Proposal

## Project Description
  An asteroid-like game with a twist.  The player controls multiple ships in a cluster, is unable to shoot, but instead has limited defensive capabilities that he/she must use wisely, while the enemy continues to track the player and grow in number.  The objective is for the player to survive until the time-limit ends.  Multiple levels, with each level subsequently harder then the last.
  
### Game Design
  1. User control and interaction between ships and player
  2. Some AI to assist the player's defensive ships
  3. More AI to control enemy ships in managing targeting, and attacking the player in a semi-realistic manner
  4. Well thought out level designs.  (Hopefully, up to three completed by Friday)
  5. Visually appealing (possibly in retro-gaming fashion, like Tron)
  6. Simple controls (possibly left-arrow and right-arrow keys, and spacebar)
  7. Intuitive play
  
### Development Tools
  1. Vanilla JS
  2. Libraries:
      * Anime
      *
