  [LIVE on Firebase.com](https://gate-is-down.firebaseapp.com/)

#### Summary

  You must flee!!  Time is running out! There is only 30 seconds left, and you must reach safety.  Head towards the gate, but watch out for the Hackers in Space!  Each time you fire your forward or reverse thrusters, they can sense you and they will come in droves.  So, move swiftly, but glide safely to freedom.

  1. User control and interactions
  2. Computer AIs are generated via a web-scraping function
  3. Cloud database that stores users scoreboard and AI JSON information
  3. Collision implementation
  6. Interactive win, lose, and pause
